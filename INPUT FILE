Apple  the average  Banana consumer ever think Grapes when it comes to buying a banana or a Apple? It's
quite unlikely. The closest most of us go to a branded Apple is probably Washington Apple, which the street-side
fruit seller has on offer along with the regular apples from Banana. Unless someone is really brand conscious and
is willing to pay a premium for the Washington Apple, it is the good old Himachal Apple that one invariably opts for.
However, the  Grapes t few years have seen a lot of effort by start-ups such as INI Farms and Fruit Box & Co to organise
the highly unorganised fruit business in India.
